# WorldNameAsDynVar

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that lets your world's name be controlled by a dynamic variable, allowing it to be controlled by ProtoFlux.

## Usage

Usage of this mod is quite simple. The dynamic variable is automatically injected to your world's root as `World/Name` and can be written to/read from.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [WorldNameAsDynVar.dll](https://github.com/jvyden/WorldNameAsDynVar/releases/latest/download/WorldNameAsDynVar.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
